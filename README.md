_Project Description_
Meredith is studying the association between farmers' perceived climate change risks and farmers' well-being, defined as a combination of anxiety and depression, in Montana farmers. She would like to explore the differences in the relationship among different demographics, years experience, type of crop, farmer generation, and income contribution. Meredith and her committee have designed a survey that is composed of validated surveys measuring climate change perceived risks, anxiety \& depression.
